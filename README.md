# 🧠 Medicine Image Dataset Automation

This repo automates the process of preparing a medicine image dataset using multiple scripts — including downloading, splitting, augmenting, and cleaning the dataset. The metadata lives in `Medicine_Details.csv` and its updated variants.

## 📁 File Structure

```



````

## ⚙️ Setup

**Dependencies:**

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Example `requirements.txt`:

```text
pandas
numpy
opencv-python
requests
Pillow
```

## 🧪 How to Use

### 1. Download Images

Download images based on medicine details in the CSV.

```bash
python download_images_4.py
```

*Edit the script to set correct CSV path and output directory.*

### 2. Remove Failed Downloads

Cleans out broken or invalid images.

```bash
python failed_image_delete_3.py
```

### 3. Filter Out Unwanted Classes

Deletes images of non-relevant categories.

```bash
python delete_others_1.py
```

*Edit the script to define which classes to keep.*

### 4. Split Dataset

Creates train/test/validation splits.

```bash
python dataset_split_6.py
```

### 5. Copy or Delete Duplicate/Corrupt Data

```bash
python dataset_copy_delete_2.py
```

### 6. Data Augmentation

Applies augmentation like rotation, flips, etc.

```bash
python data_augmentation_5.py
```

*Tune the augmentation pipeline inside the script.*

## 📊 CSV Files

* `Medicine_Details.csv`: Original metadata.
* `Medicine_Details_Updated.csv`: Cleaned-up version.
* `Medicine_Details_Updated3.csv`: Final version used in pipeline.

## ⚠️ Warnings

* Most scripts need manual configuration (CSV path, image folders, class lists).
* Make backups before running delete or overwrite scripts.
* Use a virtual environment.

## ✅ TODO

* [ ] Add CLI arguments to scripts instead of hardcoding paths.
* [ ] Add error handling and logging.
* [ ] Unit tests (seriously, do this if this goes production).
